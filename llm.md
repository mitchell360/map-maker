# Historical Map URL Construction Instructions for LLMs

**Service:** Historical Map Visualization  
**Base URL:** `https://mitchell360.com/map-maker/`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28

---

## üéØ CRITICAL: Foolproof Format

Locations and labels are **bound together** using the `~` (tilde) separator within a single parameter. This architecture makes it **impossible to create count mismatch errors**.

**Key Rule:** Every location MUST be paired with its label using `~` before adding it to the URL.

**Format:** `Location~Label` (bound together, then separate pairs with `|`)

---

## Service Overview

This is a historical map visualization service that displays locations on ancient and modern maps using Leaflet.js. It supports two types of locations:

- **Chronological locations** (blue markers) - Connected journey points with walking paths
- **Reference locations** (red markers) - Standalone historical context points

---

## Base URL Structure

```
https://mitchell360.com/map-maker/?[parameters]
```

---

## URL Parameters

### 1. Chronological Locations (Blue Markers - Connected Journey)

**Parameter Name:** `chronoLocationsAndLabels`

**Structure:** Each location is bound to its label with `~`

**Format:** `Location1~Label1|Location2~Label2|Location3~Label3`

**Separators:**
- `~` (tilde) = Binds location to its label (MANDATORY)
- `|` (pipe) = Separates multiple location-label pairs
- `%0A` = Newline within labels
- `%0A%0A` = Blank line within labels

**Location Format:** `City, Country` (e.g., `Rome, Italy` not just `Rome`)

**Example:**
```
chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria~Damascus%0A32 AD|Antioch,Turkey~Antioch%0A47 AD|Rome,Italy~Rome%0A62 AD
```

---

### 2. Reference Locations (Red Markers - Standalone)

**Parameter Name:** `referenceLocationsAndLabels`

**Structure:** Each location is bound to its label with `~`

**Format:** `Location1~Label1|Location2~Label2`

**Separators:** Same as chronological locations

**Example:**
```
referenceLocationsAndLabels=Jerusalem,Israel~Jerusalem%0A33 AD: Jerusalem, Judea%0A2025 AD: Jerusalem, Israel%0A%0AThe Church's birthplace
```

---

### 3. Map Title (Optional)

**Parameter Name:** `title`

**Purpose:** Displays a centered title at the top of the map (visible during loading and after map loads)

**Format:** URL-encoded text string

**Default:** If no title parameter is provided, displays `"Paul's Missionary Journeys"`

**Visibility:** Title appears above the loading overlay and remains visible throughout the entire session

**Style:** Elegant serif font, centered, positioned at z-index 3100 (above loading overlay)

**When to Use:**
- To customize the map for specific topics (e.g., "Key Locations in Galatians")
- To identify different missionary journeys (e.g., "Paul's Third Missionary Journey")
- To create themed maps (e.g., "Churches of Revelation" or "Journey to Rome")

**Examples:**
```
title=Paul's%20Second%20Missionary%20Journey
title=Key%20Locations%20in%20Galatians
title=Journey%20to%20Rome
title=The%20Seven%20Churches%20of%20Revelation
```

**Encoding Tips:**
- Spaces ‚Üí `%20` (e.g., "First Journey" becomes `First%20Journey`)
- Apostrophes ‚Üí `%27` (e.g., "Paul's" becomes `Paul%27s`)
- Special characters should be URL-encoded for maximum compatibility

---

## Label Format: 5-Line Structure (Highly Recommended)

For rich, professional popups, structure each label with 5 lines:

1. **Line 1:** Location name only (becomes marker label and popup title)
2. **Line 2:** Historical context ‚Üí Format: `YEAR AD: AncientName, AncientRegion`
3. **Line 3:** Modern context ‚Üí Format: `YEAR AD: ModernName, ModernCountry`
4. **Line 4:** Blank line ‚Üí Use `%0A%0A` (two newlines)
5. **Line 5+:** Detailed description (can be multiple lines)

### Complete Label Example

```
Philippi~Philippi%0A49-50 AD: Philippi, Macedonia%0A2025 AD: Filippoi, Greece%0A%0APhilippi was the first European city where Paul established a Christian congregation during his second missionary journey.
```

**Breakdown:**
- Location: `Philippi`
- Line 1: `Philippi`
- Line 2: `49-50 AD: Philippi, Macedonia`
- Line 3: `2025 AD: Filippoi, Greece`
- Line 4: `(blank line)`
- Line 5: `Philippi was the first European city...`

---

## Step-by-Step Construction Process

### Step 1: List Your Locations

Write out each location you want to show. Use `City, Country` format for accurate geocoding.

**Example List:**
- Damascus, Syria
- Antioch, Turkey
- Philippi, Greece
- Rome, Italy

---

### Step 2: Create Label for EACH Location

**CRITICAL:** You must create a label for every single location using the 5-line format.

**Example Labels:**
```
Damascus%0A32 AD: Damascus, Syria%0A2025 AD: Damascus, Syria%0A%0AConversion of Saul

Antioch%0A47 AD: Antioch, Syria%0A2025 AD: Antakya, Turkey%0A%0AMission base

Philippi%0A50 AD: Philippi, Macedonia%0A2025 AD: Filippoi, Greece%0A%0AFirst European church

Rome%0A62 AD: Rome, Roman Empire%0A2025 AD: Rome, Italy%0A%0AHouse arrest ministry
```

---

### Step 3: Bind Each Location to Its Label with ~

**MANDATORY STEP:** Connect each location to its label using the tilde separator.

**Binding Format:**
```
Damascus,Syria~Damascus%0A32 AD: Damascus, Syria%0A2025 AD: Damascus, Syria%0A%0AConversion of Saul

Antioch,Turkey~Antioch%0A47 AD: Antioch, Syria%0A2025 AD: Antakya, Turkey%0A%0AMission base

Philippi,Greece~Philippi%0A50 AD: Philippi, Macedonia%0A2025 AD: Filippoi, Greece%0A%0AFirst European church

Rome,Italy~Rome%0A62 AD: Rome, Roman Empire%0A2025 AD: Rome, Italy%0A%0AHouse arrest ministry
```

---

### Step 4: Join Pairs with | (Pipe)

Connect all location~label pairs using the pipe character.

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```
Damascus,Syria~Damascus%0A32 AD|Antioch,Turkey~Antioch%0A47 AD|Philippi,Greece~Philippi%0A50 AD|Rome,Italy~Rome%0A62 AD
```

---

### Step 5: Add Parameter Name and Build Final URL

**Option A: Without Custom Title (uses default "Paul's Missionary Journeys"):**
```
https://mitchell360.com/map-maker/?chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria~Damascus%0A32 AD|Antioch,Turkey~Antioch%0A47 AD|Philippi,Greece~Philippi%0A50 AD|Rome,Italy~Rome%0A62 AD
```

**Option B: With Custom Title (recommended for specific topics):**
```
https://mitchell360.com/map-maker/?title=Paul's%20Early%20Ministry&chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria~Damascus%0A32 AD|Antioch,Turkey~Antioch%0A47 AD|Philippi,Greece~Philippi%0A50 AD|Rome,Italy~Rome%0A62 AD
```

**üí° Tip:** Always add a descriptive title when creating maps for specific topics (e.g., "Key Locations in Galatians", "Journey to Rome", "The Seven Churches")

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to AVOID

### ‚ùå ERROR 1: Missing ~ Separator

```
?chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria|Antioch,Turkey|Rome,Italy
```

**Problem:** No labels provided, just locations

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 2: Wrong Separator

```
?chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria:Damascus|Antioch,Turkey:Antioch
```

**Problem:** Using `:` instead of `~`

---

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Bound Pairs with ~

```
?chronoLocationsAndLabels=Damascus,Syria~Damascus|Antioch,Turkey~Antioch|Rome,Italy~Rome
```

**Why This Works:** Each location is permanently bound to its label

## Encoding Reference

| Character | Encoding | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `~` | Use as-is | CRITICAL separator that binds location to label |
| `|` | Use as-is | Separates multiple location-label pairs |
| Newline | `%0A` | Creates newline within labels |
| Blank line | `%0A%0A` | Creates blank line within labels |
| Space | `%20` | Space character (usually automatic, used in title and labels) |
| Apostrophe | `%27` | Apostrophe in title (e.g., "Paul's" ‚Üí `Paul%27s`) |
| `&` | Use as-is | Separates different parameters (e.g., `?title=...&chronoLocationsAndLabels=...`) |

**Title Parameter Encoding Examples:**
- `"Paul's Second Journey"` ‚Üí `title=Paul%27s%20Second%20Journey`
- `"Key Locations in Galatians"` ‚Üí `title=Key%20Locations%20in%20Galatians`
- `"The Seven Churches"` ‚Üí `title=The%20Seven%20Churches`

---

## Placeholder Handling

**If you don't have complete information:**

- Use `Location~TBD` to explicitly mark incomplete data
- The map will display a prominent "TBD" warning in the popup
- Example: `Damascus,Syria~TBD` shows placeholder message

**TBD Message Displayed:**
```
TBD
TBD: Location information not provided
2025 AD: Unknown

## Tips for LLMs

- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL:** Always use `~` (tilde) to bind each location to its label
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY:** Every location must have a label bound to it with `~`
- ‚úÖ Count mismatches are **impossible** with this format (location and label bound together)
- ‚úÖ Always specify country/region with city names (e.g., `Rome, Italy` not `Rome`)
- ‚úÖ Use rich 5-line label format for professional, information-rich popups
- ‚úÖ First line of each label becomes the marker name displayed on map
- ‚úÖ Lines 2-3 appear in gray as historical/modern context
- ‚úÖ Line 5+ becomes the main description text in popup
- ‚úÖ Use `%0A` for line breaks, `%0A%0A` for blank lines between sections
- ‚úÖ Chronological locations are connected by walking paths in the order specified
- ‚úÖ Reference locations are standalone and never connected to anything
- ‚úÖ Keep URLs under 8000 characters for maximum compatibility
- ‚úÖ Test your URL structure before providing to ensure all `~` separators are present

---

## Error Handling

- Invalid locations skipped (geocoding failure logged to console)
- Missing labels after `~` default to location name
- Empty parameters are ignored
- TBD labels display prominent placeholder warning
- Count mismatches **IMPOSSIBLE** with new format (fundamental architecture improvement)
